# TimeCode
TimeCode, an updating text file that has the current time in 24 hour format, all done completely in NodeJS. Perfect alternative to Snaz's time feature, which currently only works on Windows. TimeCode works on any operating system compatible with NodeJS.
# Features
When executed with `node index.js` it outputs the current time in 24 hour format including minutes on the top and bottom line, the date on the second line, and the date with time and seconds on the 3rd line, on both the terminal and the `time.txt` file. <br />
For example, <br />
`13:45`<br />
`2020-09-13`<br />
`2020-09-13 13:45:22`<br />
`13:45`<br />
# Download

To download the source code, make sure you have NodeJS installed on your system. <br /> <br />
Link to NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ <br /> <br />
Then, at the top of this page, you should see a green `Code` button. Click that, download the zip, extract wherever. Use the NodeJS Command Prompt to go into the directory of wherever you put TimeCode. Type in `node index.js` and you are ready to go! You can open "time.txt" in the same TimeCode folder to display the current time of your system, in 24 hour format, up to the minute. This updates every second, to display the current time on your system as accurate as possible.
