# TimeCode
TimeCode, an updating text file that has the current time in 24 hour format. Perfect alternative to Snaz, which currently only works on Windows. TimeCode works on any operating system compatible with NodeJS.
# Download

To download the source code, make sure you have NodeJS installed on your system, then at the top of this page, you should see a green `Code` button. Click that, download the zip, extract wherever. Use the NodeJS Command Prompt to go into the directory of wherever you put TimeCode. Type in `node index.js` and you are ready to go! You can open "time.txt" in the same TimeCode folder to display the current time of your system, in 24 hour format, up to the minute. This updates every second, to display the current time on your system as accurate as possible.
